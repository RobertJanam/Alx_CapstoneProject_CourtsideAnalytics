## Project Description

In Kenya, basketball leagues, especially at the grassroots level, struggle with game data tracking and analysis, often relying on physical paper records or basic spreadsheet tools that don't provide meaningful insights. Coaches need better tools to track player performance, analyze game trends, and make data-driven decisions.

**Basketball Courtside Analytics & Tracker** is a backend API built to solve this problem. It provides a platform for coaches and team staff to record game statistics, manage teams, and receive automated performance analytics.

The API focuses on making data entry simple while delivering powerful insights through calculated metrics like player averages, team leaderboards, and quarter-by-quarter performance trends.

---

## Features

### Core MVP Features
- **User Authentication System:** JWT-based registration and login.
- **Team Management:** Coaches can create teams (with unique join codes), players can join teams, and members can be managed.
- **Game Data Entry:** Coaches can record games with team scores, opponent scores, and quarter-by-quarter breakdowns.
- **Player Statistics:** Comprehensive stats tracking (points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, turnovers, fouls, shooting percentages) for each player per game.
- **Automated Analytics:**
  - Automatic win/loss determination and point differential.
  - Player averages (PPG, APG, RPG, SPG, BPG).
  - Team leaderboards for various stats.
  - Team performance trends, including quarter analysis and win percentage.

### Enhanced Features (Implemented)
- Multiple admin roles per team.
- Full CRUD operations for games and player stats (coach only).
- Soft delete functionality for teams and members.
- Role-based permissions (Coaches vs. Players).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python:** Version 3.12.12 (Recommended for `mysqlclient` compatibility).
- **MySQL:** Version 8.0 and MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE (or any MySQL client).
- **Git:** For cloning the repository.
- **Pip:** Python package installer (usually comes with Python).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Alx_CapstoneProject_CourtsideAnalytics.git
    cd Alx_CapstoneProject_CourtsideAnalytics
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # On Windows (PowerShell)
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers djangorestframework-simplejwt
    pip install drf-yasg
    pip install mysqlclient
    pip install python-dotenv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Environment Variables
1.  Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (the same level as `manage.py`).
2.  Copy the contents from `.env.example` and fill in your values.

    ```env
    # .env.example
    # Django
    SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
    DEBUG=True

    # Database
    DB_NAME=dbname
    DB_USER=username
    DB_PASSWORD=password
    DB_HOST=hostname
    DB_PORT=portname
    ```

3. To get your secret key for local development, open your terminal and paste this:

    ```bash
    python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
    ```
    You may need to use python3 instead of python in OS using UNIX-based.

4. Then paste the secret key provided as a value in your variable SECRET_KEY. It should look something like this:

    ```env
    SECRET_KEY="django-insecure-8x^f7q%k3m#p9z$w2n&b5v@t6y*c4r!a1s"
    ```

5. If you don't have mysql workbench installed, you can use the default sqlite3.
6. After creating an env file, only copy your SECRET_KEY.
7. Replace this in your settings/development.py:

    ```env
    DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': os.getenv('DB_NAME'),
        'USER': os.getenv('DB_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD'),
        'HOST': os.getenv('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),
        'PORT': os.getenv('DB_PORT', '3306'),
        'OPTIONS': {
            'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'",
            },
        }
    }
    ```

    to this

    ```env
    DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
    ```

8. Similarly, do the same with to get the SECRET_KEY


    > **IMPORTANT:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It is already listed in `.gitignore`.

### Database Setup
*(If you have mysql workbench, you'll create the db in the application first. If you are using any other RDBMS, do what you are required. If it's sqlite3, skip the first step.)*

1.  **Create the Database:** Open MySQL Workbench and create a new database schema. The name should match the `DB_NAME` in your `.env` file.
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE courtside_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
    ```

2.  **Run Migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

3.  **Create a Superuser (Optional, for Django Admin):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

The API will now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`. You can explore the interactive documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/`.

---

## 📖 Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl`.

A typical workflow is:
1.  **Register** a new user (coach).
2.  **Login** to receive your JWT `access` token.
3.  Use this token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all subsequent requests.
4.  **Create a team**.
5.  Have a player **register**, **login**, and **join** the team using the team's unique `join_code`.
6.  As a coach, **create a game** and then **add player statistics** for that game.
7.  Explore the **analytics endpoints** to see calculated averages and leaderboards.

A detailed Postman testing sequence is provided in the main `api.md` file.

## Testing

The project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure core functionality works as expected.

To run all tests:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

---

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a standard Django MTV (Model-Template-View) pattern adapted for a RESTful API using Django REST Framework (DRF).

**Models (models.py):** Define the database structure. Key models include CustomUser, Team, TeamMember, Game, and PlayerStat.

**Serializers (serializers.py):** Act as a bridge between complex Python model instances and JSON. They handle validation and data transformation for API requests and responses.

**Views (views.py):** Contain the business logic for each API endpoint. They use DRF's generic views (like ListCreateAPIView) for efficiency and consistency, with custom permissions to enforce role-based access (coach vs. player).

**URLs (urls.py):** Route incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate view.

**Permissions:** Custom permission logic ensures that only coaches can create games or edit team details, while players have read-only access.

This separation of concerns makes the codebase modular, testable, and maintainable.
